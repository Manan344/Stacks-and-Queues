# Stacks-and-Queues

Objective - Write a program that will act as a simple calculator that supports addition, subtraction, multiplication and division operators. 
The program operates by taking in a pair of parameters (operation and number) that are separated by a space. 

For example a valid entry could consist of a "+" followed by 4.4.
This would evaluate to 4.4. If the operation and value pair "* 2" in now entered the result would evaluate to 8.8
